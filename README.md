# Codechef-1
As I was started today, codechef , very useful for learning coding , rapidly with a good pace and logics.
In this repo i had just uploaded 3 codes , as today is my first day of this platform.
The problems are like:
1.Search an element in an Array.
2.Maximum element in an Array.
3.Take discount or Not.
